# Training Course Designer

This skill provides a professional, structured process for designing high-impact corporate training programs. It is optimized based on three core principles: **reusability**, **clear inputs**, and **ready-to-use outputs**.

## Core Principles

1.  **Reusable Frameworks**: Abstracts the design process into a universal workflow with standardized templates to cover the majority of training scenarios, ensuring consistency and quality.
2.  **Ready-to-Use Deliverables**: Directly produces a complete kit of professional, usable documents (outlines, handbooks, guides) that require minimal to no further editing.
3.  **Clear Input, Stable Output**: Utilizes a structured brief to gather all necessary information upfront, eliminating guesswork and generating a consistent, predictable set of deliverables.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing a new training course, workshop, or learning program from scratch.
- Structuring a comprehensive course syllabus and timeline.
- Improving an existing training program to be more effective and engaging.
- Creating a complete set of ready-to-deliver training materials.

## The 5-Step Course Design Workflow

Follow this structured workflow to design a high-impact training course and generate a complete deliverables kit.

### Step 1: Complete the Course Design Brief

All great training starts with a clear understanding of the need. Instead of ad-hoc questions, complete the standardized **Course Design Brief**. This structured document ensures all critical information is captured upfront, eliminating guesswork and repeated follow-ups.

**Action**: Read and complete the template at `/home/ubuntu/skills/training-course-designer/references/course-design-brief-template.md`.

### Step 2: Select the Right Course Framework

Based on the primary learning goal identified in the brief, select the most appropriate course framework. This ensures the structure and activities are optimized for the desired outcome.

- **Skill-Based Training**: For developing tangible skills (e.g., sales techniques, software usage). Focuses on hands-on practice, role-playing, and feedback. Interactive time should be >50%.
- **Knowledge-Based Training**: For imparting information (e.g., product knowledge, compliance policies). Focuses on clear explanations, real-world examples, and knowledge checks. Interactive time is typically 20-30%.
- **Attitude/Behavior-Based Training**: For shifting mindsets or behaviors (e.g., leadership, teamwork). Focuses on self-reflection, group discussion, and case studies. Interactive time is typically 40-50%.

**Action**: Choose a framework that aligns with the learning objectives from the brief.

### Step 3: Design Modules and Detailed Content

With the framework selected, break the course into 3-5 logical modules. For each module, design the content flow using the 4-part structure:

1.  **Introduction (5-10 min)**: Hook attention, state objectives, and establish relevance.
2.  **Core Content (30-40% time)**: Deliver key concepts, frameworks, and knowledge in a simple, clear manner.
3.  **Practice & Application (40-60% time)**: Use activities from the Interactive Activities Library to facilitate hands-on practice, case studies, or discussions.
4.  **Summary & Action Planning (5-10 min)**: Recap key takeaways and guide participants to create personal action plans.

**Action**: Read `/home/ubuntu/skills/training-course-designer/references/interactive-activities-library.md` to select appropriate activities for each module.

### Step 4: Create a Detailed Time Schedule

Map out the entire course in a minute-by-minute schedule. This ensures a smooth flow and realistic time management.

- Schedule demanding content in the morning.
- Increase interactivity in the afternoon.
- Plan for a 10-15 minute break every 90 minutes.
- Reserve 10% of the total time as a buffer for Q&A and unexpected delays.

### Step 5: Generate the Deliverables Kit

Instead of just an outline, generate a complete, ready-to-use kit of professional documents. This ensures consistency and saves significant time in preparation.

**Action**: Use the templates in the `/home/ubuntu/skills/training-course-designer/templates/` directory to create the full set of deliverables.

## The Deliverables Kit (Standard Output)

This skill produces a comprehensive package of five key documents, ensuring a stable and predictable output:

1.  **Course Outline Document**: The master document detailing the course background, audience, objectives, schedule, and module-by-module content breakdown.
2.  **Instructor Guide**: A detailed guide for the facilitator, including talking points, activity instructions, time cues, and materials checklist.
3.  **Participant Handbook**: A workbook for learners, including key concepts, space for notes, exercise worksheets, and reference materials.
4.  **Interactive Activity Sheets**: Ready-to-print instruction sheets for each major interactive activity.
5.  **Evaluation & Follow-up Plan**: A plan that includes a post-training evaluation survey (Kirkpatrick Level 1 & 2) and a template for a 30-day follow-up to assess on-the-job application (Level 3).
